## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in your Firebase credentials in the `.env` file

3. Set up Firebase Service Account for API Server:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example service account file
   cp setup/service-account-example.json setup/service-account.json
   
   # Then edit setup/service-account.json with your Firebase Admin SDK credentials
   # You can download this file from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts
   ```

4. The project no longer requires Firebase Realtime Database - all functionality has been migrated to Firestore.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Initialize Firestore collections (only needed once)
node setup/firestore-collections.js

# Start API server (in one terminal)
node server/api-routes.js

# Start development server (in another terminal)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

- `src/components/`: UI components organized by feature
- `src/contexts/`: React context providers
- `src/pages/`: Main page components
- `src/types/`: TypeScript interfaces and types
- `src/utils/`: Helper functions and utilities

## Universal Wealth Vision

A new paradigm for wealth that is distributed rather than concentrated, communal rather than individualistic, and inclusive by design rather than as an afterthought.
