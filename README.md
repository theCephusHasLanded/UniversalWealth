## Security Architecture

LKHN Universal Wealth implements enterprise-grade security:

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive financial data
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: TOTP and WebAuthn support beyond basic password authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Least-privilege principle implementation
- **API Security**: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE and short-lived JWTs for API authentication
- **Data Privacy**: Minimized data collection with GDPR/CCPA compliance by design

See our [security architecture documentation](/setup/security-architecture.md) for details.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in your Firebase credentials in the `.env` file

3. Set up Firebase Service Account for API Server:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example service account file
   cp setup/service-account-example.json setup/service-account.json
   
   # Then edit setup/service-account.json with your Firebase Admin SDK credentials
   # You can download this file from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts
   ```

4. The project no longer requires Firebase Realtime Database - all functionality has been migrated to Firestore.

### Vercel Deployment

For proper production deployment to Vercel:

1. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Set all Firebase environment variables in your Vercel project settings:
     ```
     VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
     VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
     VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
     VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
     VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
     VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
     VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
     ```
   - Add `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` for feedback functionality
   - Set `NODE_ENV=production`

2. **Authentication**:
   - The platform supports email/password and Google authentication
   - The code includes fallback mechanisms for when Firebase isn't properly initialized

See `vercel-env-setup.md` for detailed instructions.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Initialize Firestore collections (only needed once)
node setup/firestore-collections.js

# Start API server (in one terminal)
node server/api-routes.js

# Start development server (in another terminal)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```
