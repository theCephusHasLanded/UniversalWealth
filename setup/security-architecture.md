# LKHN Universal Wealth Security Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security architecture for the LKHN Universal Wealth application, focusing on implementation strategies suitable for a solo developer building a wealth management application.

## 1. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

### Data at Rest Encryption
- **Client-side encryption** using Web Crypto API with AES-256-GCM
- **Key derivation** with PBKDF2 (100,000+ iterations)
- **Master key management** with per-user encryption keys

### Implementation Steps
1. Generate user-specific encryption keys from credentials using PBKDF2
2. Encrypt sensitive data client-side before storage in Firebase
3. Implement envelope encryption (data encrypted with data key, data key encrypted with master key)
4. Store encrypted master keys in Firebase, retrievable only with valid user authentication

### Key Rotation and Backup
- Implement key rotation every 90 days
- Back up encrypted keys with secure cloud storage
- Create key recovery mechanism using split knowledge/dual control

## 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### Tech Stack
- Firebase Authentication (base layer)
- Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) with `otplib`
- WebAuthn for biometric/hardware security keys

### Implementation
1. Extend Firebase Auth with custom MFA verification
2. Implement TOTP with QR code setup and recovery codes
3. Add WebAuthn support for passwordless or second-factor authentication
4. Store MFA verification state in secure session cookies

## 3. Secure Coding Practices

### Static Analysis
- ESLint with security plugins (`eslint-plugin-security`)
- SonarQube for code quality and vulnerability detection
- TypeScript for type safety

### Dependency Management
- Dependabot for automated dependency updates
- npm audit automated checks in CI pipeline
- Snyk for deeper dependency vulnerability scanning

## 4. API and Third-Party Security

### Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for API authentication
- JWT with short expiration (15 minutes) and refresh tokens
- API key rotation and secret management

### Integration Architecture
- API Gateway pattern for third-party access control
- Credential isolation per integration
- Request/response validation and sanitization

## 5. Data Minimization and Privacy

### Data Flow
- Collect only necessary data with explicit purpose limitation
- Implement data classification system (PII, financial, preferences)
- Apply pseudonymization techniques where possible

### Consent Management
- Granular consent tracking in Firestore
- Consent versioning with timestamp and scope
- Self-service privacy dashboard for data subject rights

## 6. Monitoring and Anomaly Detection

### Monitoring Stack
- Firebase Security Rules with custom functions
- Google Cloud Logging centralized logs
- Prometheus and Grafana for metrics visualization

### Anomaly Detection
- Login attempt pattern analysis
- Unusual transaction monitoring
- Geographic access anomaly detection

## 7. Security Audits and Testing

### Solo Developer Workflow
- Quarterly self-assessment using OWASP Top 10
- Automated vulnerability scanning with OWASP ZAP
- Partner with security researchers through bug bounty programs

### Penetration Testing
- Annual third-party penetration test
- Regular OWASP ZAP scanning
- Continuous integration security testing

## 8. Secure Infrastructure

### Cloud Architecture
- Firebase hosting with Google Cloud Platform
- Virtual Private Cloud configuration
- IP allowlisting and geofencing

### Zero-Trust Implementation
- Identity-aware proxy (Cloud IAP)
- Least privilege service accounts
- Resource-based access policies

## 9. Role-Based Access Control

### User Role Schema
```json
{
  "roles": {
    "admin": {
      "permissions": ["read:all", "write:all", "delete:all"]
    },
    "advisor": {
      "permissions": ["read:client_data", "write:recommendations"]
    },
    "client": {
      "permissions": ["read:own_data", "write:own_profile"]
    },
    "guest": {
      "permissions": ["read:public"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Implementation
- Custom claims in Firebase Auth for role storage
- Server-side role verification for all sensitive operations
- Frontend permission-based UI rendering

## 10. Compliance Framework

### Regulatory Coverage
- GDPR: Data portability, right to be forgotten, consent tracking
- CCPA: Opt-out workflows, data inventory, disclosure tracking
- PCI DSS: Tokenization for payment information

### Documentation and Audit Trails
- Automated compliance documentation generation
- Immutable audit logs for all data access and changes
- Regular compliance self-assessment tools

## Next Steps

This architecture will be implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Basic authentication enhancements and E2EE foundation
2. **Phase 2**: MFA, RBAC, and secure API integrations
3. **Phase 3**: Monitoring, anomaly detection, and compliance framework

*This document will be updated as implementation progresses.*
